This repository contains the answers to the peer reviewed assignment for thr Getting and Cleaning Data course project. It contains a code book as well as the script needed in creating a tidy data set

The CodeBook.md a code book describes the variablesand the data, and transformations performed to clean up the data. 

run_analysis.R performs the following;
1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
