The run_analysis.R script performs the following task:

1.The dataset was downloaded from the url "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip" and was extracted into a folder called "UCI HAR Dataset"

2. Each data  was assigned a descriptive column name
features <- features.txt :
This is a list containing all features

activities <- activity_labels.txt : This contains the list of activities which are linked to a class label

subject_test <- test/subject_test.txt :This refers to volunteer subjects who performed the activities for the testing sample.

x_test <- test/X_test.txt : These are the recorded test set.

y_test <- test/y_test.txt : These are the recorded test labels.

subject_train <- test/subject_train.txt : This refers to volunteer subjects who performed the activities for the training sample.

x_train <- test/X_train.txt : These are the recorded training set.

y_train <- test/y_train.txt : These are the recorded training labels.

3. The train and test data were then merged to create one data set
X was created by merging x_train and x_test using rbind() function.

Y was created by merging y_train and y_test using rbind() function

Subject was created by merging subject_train and subject_test using rbind() function

Merged_Data was created by merging Subject, Y and X using cbind() function

4. A Tidydata was created by extracting only the measurements of the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. The TidyData was created by selecting these columns: subject, activity_code and the measurements containing mean and standard deviation (std) for each measurement.

5. Descriptive activity names were used to name the activities in the data set. This was done by replacing the numbers in the activity_code column with the corresponding activity in the second column of the activities variable.

6.The data set were approraitely labeled with descriptive variable names;
 Acc was replaced by Accelerometer
 Gyro was replaced by Gyroscope
 BodyBody was replaced by Body
 Mag was replaced by Magnitude
 f was replaced by Frequency
 t was replaced by Time

7. A second,independent tidy dataset (Indy_data) with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject Was created
